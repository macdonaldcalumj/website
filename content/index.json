  "intro": "Hi, I'm Calum, a full stack developer based in London.  I've spent the last five years working on custom software for creating engaging experiences for international brands' events around the world.\n\nSince 2013 I have used Python and Django regularly and it remains my back end framework of choice.  The majority of projects I've developed will be 'headless' and use the Django REST Framework or Django Channels to allow a wide range of other applications to communication with it from GUIs to web frontends to smaller scripts controlling hardware.\n\nOther technologies I use include:\n\n* Docker is always used for streamlining the setup and deployment of Django applications\n* FFmpeg for any video processing\n* Netlify for deploying front end applications\n* Pillow is an image processing library for Python that I use for most image of my image manipulation\n* Traefik makes handling my Docker containers on web servers a lot simpler\n* Vue.js is my current preferred choice for web front ends",
