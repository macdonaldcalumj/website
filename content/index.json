  "intro": "Hi, I'm a full stack developer based in London.  I've spent the last five years working on custom software for creating engaging experiences for international brands' events around the world.\n\nFor backend work I use the Python based Django framework and have done since 2013.  I frequently use it with the Django REST Framework for API creation and Django Channels for websocket connections.  Most of the work I've done requires automated image or video manipulation for which I will use the Pillow Python library for images and FFmpeg for video processing.\n\nMy preferred method for front end development is the Vue JavaScript framework.  I have used it for both web based projects and desktop applications made with Electron.  In the past I have also developed front ends with Django's template system as well as WordPress websites but now typically prefer decoupling the front and back ends.",
