Say Fromage is a company specialising in experiential video/photographic content for events of all sizes, ranging from photo booths at birthday parties to worldwide promotions for some of the biggest brands in the world.  The software I worked on there was used by the likes of Adidas, Burberry, Disney, Google, PlayStation, Spotify, Vogue and more.

As the sole developer I typically handled the whole development process of bespoke software solutions for clients from choosing the best platforms to build upon to deciding on the hardware required to make it happen.  I also developed internal systems were used daily for years to keep the company operating smoothly.
