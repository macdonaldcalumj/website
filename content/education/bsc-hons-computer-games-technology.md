When I was younger I wanted to be a games developer so I got a degree in games technology.  The course was largely focused on mathematics, physics, graphics programming and developing on multiple platforms such as GameBoy Advance, PlayStation 2 and Windows.  In addition to those subjects I took the audio option for all the optional modules we were offered and ended up writing my dissertation on the plausibility of using procedurally generated sound effects in games.
