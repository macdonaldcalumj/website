Charlotte Tilbury created a makeup range called 'Beauty Filters' which used red and blue in the marketing evoking digital filters on social media platforms referencing the classic red/blue 3D videos.  Part of this marketing campaign included custom photo booths in several shopping centres.

These booths output animated videos created from one photo taken from a camera with a stereoscopic lens typically used for making images to be viewed in 3D.  The images produced by these lenses had the subject appear twice but from slightly different angles and was then split into two separate images which were then animated with multiple colour shifting effects.

A problem with the lenses however was that the two images would not necesarilly be level on the output image so that when animated the subject could distractingly move up and down.  To rectify this issue I used facial recognition to make sure the faces were level when extracted from the original image.
