At Crufts 2019 Purina wanted a unique digital experience based on dog training to fit the event.  The result was an augmented reality game where users be taught some hand movements used by professional dog trainers to have a virtual puppy perform a series of tricks.

To accomplish this a Microsoft Kinect 2 camera was used to track the users as well as displaying them on screen beside the puppy.  The application, which was built in Unity, would instruct the user on the three programmed in gestures and once they had successfully performed them would record the user for 30 seconds as they made the puppy perform for them.  When their time was up the user could email themselves the footage as well as create a printout of them with the puppy.
